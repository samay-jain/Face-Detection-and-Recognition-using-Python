# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-using-Python
I have created the facial recognition model using the Python Pickle Module, which is open-source. Firstly, I have generated a dataset of my face using the Python file "CapImg.py," which captures 300 images automatically in a single execution. It also asks for your name before capturing the images, and all these images are saved in a file named "dataset," which contains another folder named "yours which will be later used for training the model.

In the next step, you need to download the "TrainModel.py" Python file that, on execution, trains the pickle model. This step is the most important in the whole project. You can download the "TrainModel.py" file using the link given below.

Later in the next step, you are just needed to execute the model on a real-time webcam using the Python file "RecFace.py". It recognizes the faces present in the frame captured by the webcam by using the pickle model.

You can watch the final output of the project using the below link.
